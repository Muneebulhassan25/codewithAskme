<h2>WHY TO BUY SAMSUNG GALAXY S23 ULTRA?</h2>
<p>Deciding whether it's time to upgrade your phone can be challenging. That's especially true if you're eyeballing a phone as expensive as the Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra, which starts at PKR 650,000 with a discount.The answer largely depends on which phone you own, the age and condition of it and your budget. There's no single approach that applies to everyone, but taking these factors into account can help you with the decision. If your phone is too old to receive new Android platform upgrades, that's also a good sign that you should consider upgrading. <br> But keep in mind that it may not be the best time to upgrade to a new Galaxy phone. Samsung typically releases new flagship Galaxy phones in the first few months of the year, and a report from Korean news outlet SBS Biz suggests the Galaxy S24 could arrive in January. That means your Galaxy S23 Ultra could quickly feel outdated if you buy one right now. </p>

<h2>MediaTek to announce an octa-core LTE chipset in January</h2>
<p>MediaTek recently announced its first true-octa core processor, as part of the MT6592 chipset. The successor of this SoC is allegedly in the works and the upcoming chip that is reportedly known as MT6595 is rumored to go official in the January, next year. <br> Until now, MediaTek has been producing chipsets, which are ideal for mid-range and budget friendly smartphones. However, things might soon change for the Taiwanese semi-conductor company and we really hope the company rises its game and poses a more serious threat to Qualcomm and lightens up the development race.</p>
